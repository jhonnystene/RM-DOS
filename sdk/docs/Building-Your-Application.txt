Building RM-DOS Applications
==================

1. Ensure you have the latest RMDOS.asm file
	This can be found in the sdk/ folder in the RM-DOS project. It is regenerated with every run of build.sh.
2. Structure your application correctly
	For the API file to work as intended, your %include directive MUST be at the top of the file (comments, of course, can go above it)
	See sdk/example-about.asm for an example.
3. Build the application
	The recommended NASM command for this is as follows:
	nasm -O0 -w+orphan-labels -f bin -o [output location] [filename]
4. Insert the application into an RM-DOS disk image using rmfs-insert:
	This assumes you already have rmfs-insert from a successful build. If not, rmfs-insert can be built with:
		gcc -Wall -o rmfs-insert tools/rmfs-insert.c
	Insert the file with the following command:
	./rmfs-insert [disk image path] [outputted binary path] [desired filename on disk, all caps]
