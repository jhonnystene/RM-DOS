RMFS File System Documentation
===========

Why another filesystem?
	Because implementing other file systems was too much work.

Notes:
	- The implementation of RMFS in RM-DOS does not do sanity checking, it assumes everything is reasonable
	- Sectors should be called "blocks" when being shown to the end-user

Disk Layout:
	Boot sector:
		0-15 Bytes: Entry code
		16-29 Bytes: Volume label (null-terminated)
		30-31 Bytes: Magic Number 0xDA31
		32-511 Bytes: Code + BIOS magic

	Sector 1:
		File Table:
			[12 bytes] - Filename (any ASCII characters, null-terminated)
			[2 bytes] - First sector (0 for empty)
			[2 bytes] - Reserved
		There is room for 32 files in the file table.

	Sector 2-8:
		Allocation Table:
			[2 bytes] - Next sector (FFFF for last, 0000 for unused)
		The allocation table can be as large as 128 sectors to account for disks as big as 32 MiB in size, 
		however RM-DOS currently doesn't have support for this due to the 64 KiB address space available to the kernel.

	Sector 8+:
		File data
